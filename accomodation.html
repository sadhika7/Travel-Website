  <h3>Accomodation in Nepal</h3>
  <p>If you’re worried about going without a bed in Nepal, don’t be - there are
    accommodation options literally everywhere. Established tourist centres offer
    the greatest variety, including Kathmandu, Pokhara and Chitwan, where you’ll find
    everything from glamorous  5-star to questionably basic.Up in the mountains, including
    Everest Base Camp and the Annapurna Circuit, you'll mostly find pretty basic teahouses and
    trekking lodges. Further afar, teahouses, home-stays and guesthouses exist the most off the
    beaten track areas. </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Cost of Accommodation in Nepal</h3>
    <p>Prices vary dramatically, depending on where you stay and when. Trekking lodges can cost as
      little as a few dollars a night, while a safari lodge in Chitwan may set you back $250 a night.
      For the most part, accommodation in Nepal is extremely affordable, and the most common form of accommodation,
      guest houses, will charge between $5 - $35 per night.Kathmandu and Pokhara are obviously where the majority of
      accommodation exists, and therefore the prices can be slightly higher than other parts of the country. Teahouses
      and trekking lodges in the mountains cost very little, but due to the altitude and conditions they are very rudimentary.
      Don't expect anything more than a wooden single bed, generally in a shared room.
     If you’re travelling outside of high season, prices can drop, so always ask if any discount is applicable.</p>
     <br>
     <h3>Standard of Accommodation in Nepal</h3>
     <p>On the whole, accommodation in Nepal is pretty standard, and similar to what you'll find throughout Asia.
     Most places have a range of rooms, from budget to doubles with en-suite. It's worth noting that there's currently
     no regulating body for accommodation in Nepal, so we recommend reading reviews very carefully. Beware that cheaper
     accommodation can be of a really poor standard; if you’re backpacking, this might be okay, but otherwise, invest a
     few extra dollars for something nicer.</p>
